# tempy
A matplotlib gui for TEMPO, based on pyplotres by Patrick Lazarus.

Usage: `tem.py -f [PARFILE] [TIMFILE]`

Or if you've already run TEMPO in the directory and don't want to run it again, simply run tempy without arguments.  Also, many of the pyplotres arguments still work.  Run tempy -h to see command line arguments, and press 'h' while running to see key commands.

### Notable changes from pyplotres
* Can run TEMPO!
* Insert/remove phase wraps graphically
* Insert/remove JUMPs graphically
* Select parameters to include in next fit
* Step back through fit history
