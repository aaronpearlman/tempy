# tempy
A matplotlib gui for TEMPO, based on pyplotres by Patrick Lazarus.

Usage: `tempy.py -f [PARFILE] [TIMFILE]`

Or if you've already run TEMPO in the directory and don't want to run it again, simply run tempy without arguments.

### Notable changes from pyplotres
* Can run TEMPO!
* Insert/remove phase wraps graphically
* Insert/remove JUMPs graphically
* Select parameters to include in next fit
* Step back through fit history
